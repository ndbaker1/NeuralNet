# NeuralNet
**Forward Feeding Neural Network** Model in Java <br>
Constructed using a 3D Array of doubles to simulate the effects of a Neuron firing in a Neural Network.

---
Operations on the Neural Network include basic **genetic algorithms** which cover:
- Random Mutation of Neuron weights
- Reproductive success as dictated by a fitness function

Networks are produced in mass and assigned to controllable bodies in my simplistic physics-driven simulation.<br> This allows me to test the Network's ability to evolve and keep track of the number of generations passed.
